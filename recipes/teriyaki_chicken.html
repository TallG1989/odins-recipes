        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>650g chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp ginger puree</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>For the teriyaki sauce</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tsp cornflour</li>
            <li>100ml soy sauce</li>
            <li>50ml water</li>
            <li>3 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>2 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp ginger puree</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp dried chilli flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to make it</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p1>Mix the teriyaki sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Begin with the cornflour and gradually add the soy sauce, whisking so there are no lumps. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients.</p1>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p2>Heat the oil in a frying pan until very hot.</p2>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p3>Add the chicken and cook for about 10-15 minutes until the chicken is almost cooked through.</p3>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p4>Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 3 or 4 more minutes until softened.</p4>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p5>Add the teriyaki sauce ingredients and cook for about 5 minutes until everything is well coated and thickened.</p5>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p6>While the chicken is cooking, I cook some rice in the bottom of a steamer pan and then add some green vegetables to the steamer part on top for the last 5 minutes. (You can mix the cooked broccoli into the sauce and chicken just before serving if you'd like it coated in sauce.)</p6>
